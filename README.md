## Data Analysis Process:

#### 1. Data Extraction:
Data extraction involves gathering relevant datasets from various sources, including databases, APIs, files, or web scraping. The data collected should align with the project's objectives and research questions.

#### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Data cleaning is a crucial step to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and addressing outliers or errors. Preprocessing may also include data transformation, normalization, or feature engineering to prepare the data for analysis.

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA involves exploring and understanding the dataset through statistical summaries, visualization techniques, and descriptive analytics. This step helps identify patterns, trends, relationships, and potential insights in the data.

#### 4. Data Modeling and Analysis:
Data modeling encompasses various techniques, including statistical modeling, machine learning algorithms, or predictive analytics, to extract meaningful information from the data. This step involves selecting appropriate models, training them on the dataset, and evaluating their performance.

#### 5. Interpretation and Insights:
Interpreting the results of data analysis involves drawing conclusions, making inferences, and deriving actionable insights from the findings. This step aims to answer research questions, address business objectives, or inform decision-making processes.

#### 6. Data Visualization:
Data visualization is an essential aspect of data analysis, as it helps communicate insights effectively through charts, graphs, dashboards, or interactive visualizations. Visualizations enhance understanding, facilitate storytelling, and enable stakeholders to grasp complex information intuitively.
